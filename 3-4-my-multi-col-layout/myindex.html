                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈæbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this sound listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July
                    2015) was an Indian scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
                    and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
                    four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                    Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                    civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the
                    Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4]
                    He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</p>

                <p> About this sound listen (help·info); 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)[2] was an Indian mathematician who
                    lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,
                    he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued
                    fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable. Ramanujan initially
                    developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians.
                    Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with
                    the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing the extraordinary
                    work sent to him as samples, Hardy arranged travel for Ramanujan to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan
